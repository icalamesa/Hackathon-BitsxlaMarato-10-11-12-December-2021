Encantat de coneixe't, soc en PandBot i ens endisarem en una aventura on aprendrem molt de nosaltres.

## Inspiration
Sometimes mental health problems emerge from daily tasks and routines. That's why we found out it would be helpful to create a tool to prevent this kind of issues.  As a result, we decided to do a Telegram bot because of its accessibility and simplicity.

## What it does
Pandbot's main function is to go along with the user during daily life, to make the user **smile** and overcome his/her/their situation. User can send media from themselves to the bot and when they need it the bot will resend these good moments. Moreover, the bot sends daily challenges related to self-esteem such as walking or meditating.
Finally we implemented a message and media system to resend messages to their future themselves.

## How we built it
We used python language to program the bot from Telegram, moreover we used Inkscape to graphically design the Pandbot.

## Challenges we ran into
Programming the bot itself is a big challenge for us. We also had difficulties debugging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Mostly, we are proud of programming the bot.

## What we learned
We learn that mental health is a really big issue in our society that anyone can suffer. We really need to work on new technologies to help solving these problems.

## What's next for Pandbot
We thought about adding a voice recogniser feature to detect whether the user feels better or not.
